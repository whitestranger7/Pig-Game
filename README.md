<b>My first test game named "Pig Game"</b><br>

------------------------------------------------------------

Rules:<br>

Active player make turn rolling dice (it rolled randomly). That dice get summed in current score of active player.
If active player rolled 1 - his current score getting lost and become 0. And active player will be switched. 
So active player can hold his current score and set it to global score and save his score. After holding score the active player will be switched and his current score will become 0 again, but global score remain. Players will roll dices as long as one of them haven't 100 in global score.
When "New Game" button was clicked - the game will be set up to new game<br>
